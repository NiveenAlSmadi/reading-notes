# Comparison and logical operators:
n JavaScript, there are a number of comparison operators that you can use to evaluate whether given values are different or equal, 
as well as if a value is greater than or less than another. Often, these operators are used with stored values in variables.
Comparison operators all return a Boolean (logical) value of true or false.
  examples:
==	Equal to
!=	Not equal to
===	Strictly equal to with no type conversion
! ==	Strictly unequal to with no type conversion
>	Greater than
>=	Greater than or equal to
<	Less than
<=	Less than or equal to
  
 # logical operators:
  There are four logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT), . 
Although they are called “logical”, they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean. Their result can also be of any type
 # Looping 
  in programminglanguages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true.
1. while loop: A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.
 The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.
 2. for loop :for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a while loop,
All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statement
