## Primer on Python Decorators
a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.
In Python, functions are first-class objects. This means that functions can be passed around and used as arguments, just like any other object (string, int, float, list, and so on).
It’s possible to define functions inside other functions. Such functions are called inner functions.
