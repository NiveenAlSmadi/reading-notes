# Testing and Modules
- TTD:
stands for Test-Driven Development, which is the design step for tests on the code.

- Unit tests :
Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

# Recursion
- Recursion: The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.

- the base condition : In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.

- example: Recursive adding 

	f(n) = 1                  n=1

	f(n) = n + f(n-1)    n>1
