# How Computers Work
in these day we see computers in everywhere with diffrent type , computer changing the world .
# but what really makes a computer, a computer ?
take input , storage it , processing,output results 
The earliest computers were made out of wood and metal , with mechanical levers and gears 
computer started out as basic calculaters 
- input : stuff thst the world dose or thst you do thst makes the computer do stuff , tell computers what to do 
- storage: different inputs give a computer information , which is then stored in memory 
- proccessing: takes information from memory then changes it using a algorithm (serial commands), then it sends the processed inf back to the memory again . 
- output: the process will continues until processed info is ready to be output , com display can show text, ohoto , videos etc ..
or may include signals to control robot 
# Binary & Data
computers work on ones and zeros ,inside a computer are electric wires and cct that caryy all the info in a computer 
for electristy one  wire represnt no , and one wire represent off .

- bit : the smallest piece of information a computer can store 
like this :
1 wire 0 1 
2 wire 00 01 10 11 
3 wire 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111
# Circuits and Logic 
every input or outout of a computer is effectively a type of information , which can be represented by on or off electrical signals or ones and zeros 
computer needs to mpdify and combaine the input signals ,to do this , a computer uses millions of teeny electronic components , which come together to form cct 
# hardware and software 
Hardware is a physical device that is capable of performing tasks and execution based on software whereas Software is a set of instructions given to a computer or other hardware to perform a certain task.
