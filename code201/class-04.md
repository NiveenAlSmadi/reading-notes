# Link to an Email Address
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):

Example

<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>


# so Links are
- created using the <a> element.
- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
-  You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

< section> - Defines a section in a document
< article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content

# JS :
## FUNCTIONS :
simply its bunsh of steps that work step by step to achive goal, and its reusable

## How to creat a Function :
first of all you need to start by calling function, then give it a name after space like function sleep() *follwd with prentheses, and finly we add the curly braces function sleep(){} and betwin them will have the task like function sleep(){document.write('Heloo world')};

## Calling a Function :
after creating the function it will stay there wating for call to start, and this happen with only 1 line! by caling the function name folowed with parantheses like: sleep();, after excuting the function it will countinue the code at the after the same calling line...

## Function witch need information:
sometimes the function needs specafic information to use in and it will be inside the paranthases acting like varubles only inside the function.. like: function pluse(x, y){}, and we must let th last step of the function in this case is to return the varubles like: function pluse(x, y){(the steps); return x + y} and when we call that kind of functions we must to mention the informations value inside the paranthses like: pluse(5, 6)

simply “two heads are better than one”, the pair programs helps you improve the quality of your code produce

the main idea depends on tow Props: 

- Driver : is the programmer who is typing codes, Handling the “mechanics” of coding, manages the text editor, switching files, version control the programmer also should had skills like: explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves

- Navigator : who are uses their words to guide the Driver, thinks about the big picture,what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs
