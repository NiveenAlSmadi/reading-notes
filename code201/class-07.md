# Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
# tips
Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.


# How to create tables??
- <table>
The <table> element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.
- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web
page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the <tr> element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a
header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>,
<tbody>, and <tfoot>

# “Functions, Methods, and Objects”
## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

## objects : 
with new key word witch create a blanck object and you add properties and methods to.. var hotel = new opject(); you can update it normaly useing 'the dot/bracket notation'
## Arrays:
witch actuly a special type of objects witch also can carry: {an other arrys, other objects, arrys had object

1. BROWSER OBJECT MODE
2. DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
3. GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS 
 

1. Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.



2. An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
3. In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.



4. JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

5. Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).


6. Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
