# Text in HTML 
When we  creating a web page, we must  add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the page.These tags provide extra meaning to the btrowser .
- Headings :
HTML offers six levels of heading tags, through ; the higher the heading level number, the greater its importance — therefore tag defines the most important heading, whereas the tag defines the least important heading in the document. By default, browsers display headings in larger and bolder font than normal text.

- Paragraph: The tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tag. So anything mentioned within and is treated as a paragraph 
![P](https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.NiwLjz8eTxjuZgBLI6QSngHaCc&pid=Api&P=0&w=484&h=161)

- Bold & Italic :
1.  Make some text bold (without marking it as important): //<B>
2. <i> - Italic text 

- Superscript &Subscrip :
1. The sup element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power such
as 22.
2. The sub element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas such as H2
0.

- Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules

# Semantic Markup
 its text elements that are not intended to affect the
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the
pages .

## so HTML elements are used to

1. describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
2. They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

# Nivo Quiz

2. which is the correct way to tag an image?

# What CSS does ?



![css](https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.J_93nzSPw4JS9Y_mFqZ9MQHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&w=300&h=300)



CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear  works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration .
# CSS style types 



![CSS](https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Ii2aI9dTV7LfJJS_Sv5WQQHaFf&pid=Api&P=0&w=209&h=156)



# Css  Benefits ...


 1. CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.

2.  Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.

3. CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page


# Nivo Quiz 

## Q 1 - Which of the following is a component of CSS style rule?

A - Selector

B - Property

C - Value

D - All of the above.



## Q 2 - CSS stand of what ??


# javaScript 
- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon.
- we  should write comments to explain what our code does.
They help make our code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.


## WHAT IS A VARIABLE?

- A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables. 


![js](https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.sap9yomcquBOxpoTaRygRwAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&w=287&h=153)

## Data Type 



![data](https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.-sxX6kUJopooBNrUaLZa_gHaDd&pid=Api&P=0&w=391&h=183)



## what is the  ARRAYS ?
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.



![arrays](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Nob83Zs02qIHcAWVcWnpngHaEH&pid=Api&P=0&w=301&h=168)


## so js 

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9) strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.


# Decisions and Loops 

- DECISIONS
Using the results of
evaluations, you can
decide which path your
script should go down

- LOOPS
There are also many
occasions where you will
want to perform the same
set of steps repeatedly 

## Operators

# Conditional Statements
onditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
