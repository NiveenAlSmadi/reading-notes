allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!

* @keyframes 

* animation-name 

* animation-duration :     
  * The animation-duration property defines how long time an animation should take to complete. If the animation-duration property is not specified, no animation will occur, because the default value is 0s (0 seconds). 

* animation-delay :
   * pecifies a delay for the start of an animation.

* animation-iteration-count :

  * specifies the number of times an animation should run.

* animation-direction :

      * pecifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.


* animation-timing-function :

      * specifies the speed curve of the animation.

* animation-fill-mode :
    * specifies a style for the target element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both).
