## Introduction 
HTML is the standard markup language for creating **Web pages**, also HTML describes the structure of a Web page.

there is Many books that teach HTML resemble dull manuals. To make it easier for you to learn, so all this summary from
[Duckett HTML book](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/) and its Highly recommended for beginners in programming :

 
 ## See how HTML describes the structure of a web page??

 **The structure** is very similar when a news story is viewed online (although it may also feature audio or video) so The use of headings and
subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information. for example structure added to a Word document to make it easier to understand.  so We use
structure in the same way when writing web pages.

## HTML Describes the Structure of Pages .
To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.
for example You can see HTML code below :


 ![CODE](https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.y4vxXzBsVl9q2309bvLWpgHaDA&pid=Api&P=0&w=381&h=156)
 
**HTML code**  is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: **an opening tag** and a **closing tag** .
we note that in previos code  There are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag. **SO what is these Tags?**
Tags act like containers ,They tell us  something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
## Tags 
 here is some of main tags :
- The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code
- The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing </body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
- Words between h1 and /h1 are a main heading.
- A paragraph of text appears between these p and /P tags.
- Another sub-heading inside h2 and /h2 tags.
 
## A Closer Look at Tags 
![closer code](https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.NPBAkO5y-2yIzHg2nZGlCgHaBM&pid=Api&P=0&w=515&h=83)


**Attributes** provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element


## Body, Head & Title
- Body tag :Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
- Head tag :This contains information about the page rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window
- title tag :The contents of the title element are either shown in the top of the browser.

### If you want to add a comment 
to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:

-Every **HTML element** can carry the *id attribute* It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.nt can also carry a *class attribute*
Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document.

-Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as *block level elements.*

-Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as *inline elements*

## div, span and iframe

- <div> The div element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box. For example, you might create a <div> element to contain all of the elements for the header of your site (the logo and the navigation)



![div](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.I-tsImYHluMVYr22NK9ztQHaFj&pid=Api&P=0&w=213&h=161)

- <span>  The span element acts like an inline equivalent of the div element. It is used to either:
 
1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text
2. Contain a number of inline elements

![span](https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.tPbj61nu4qOU1JypoBZdugAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&w=300&h=300)
 
-<iframe> An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.
 There are afew attributes that you will need to know to use it:
 
 
1. **src** :
The src attribute specifies the
URL of the page to show in the
frame.

2. **height**:
The height attribute specifies
the height of the iframe in pixels.

3. **width**:
The width attribute specifies
the width of the iframe in pixels.

- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.

![meta](https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.81-aJ_zpLlk5rJisoydljAAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&w=256&h=181)

- Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©

# NIVO QUIZ
