-JavaScript is easy to learn.
# to write a script 
you need to first state your goal and list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve.
- Vocabulary: The words that computers understand 
â€¢ Syntax: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow
- Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations.
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 
Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 
# EXPRESSIONS 
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 
1.EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
2.EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE 
# OPERATORS 
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 
# STRING OPERATOR 
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
example:
var firstName = 'Ivy ' ;
var lastName = ' Stone' ; 
var ful l Name = f irstName + l astName; 
# WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, 
you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
A function created with a function declaration is a Function object and has all the properties, methods and behavior of Function objects.
A function can also be created using an expression
