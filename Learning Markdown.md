 # Welcome Again To Niveen's Notes 
 After I summary before about **GROWTH MINDSET**, now on this page, I will present a simple summarizes about the topics i learned ABOUT 
 * Markdown 
 * GitHub pages 
 * GitHub Markdown syntax 
 so I hope you find it useful : 
 ## First of all I will talk about **MARKDOWN** 
 **Markdown** is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform, so Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
 SO you can use litters like # or * to make different styles and format 
 ### Here’s an overview of [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files: 
 1. Headers 
 2. Emphasis
 3. Lists 
 4. Ordered  
 5. Images 
 6. Links 

## Let's Talk about **GitHub pages**:
GitHub Pages is a static web hosting service offered by GitHub since 2008 to GitHub users for hosting user blogs, project documentation, or even whole books created as a page. All GitHub Pages content is stored in a Git repository, either as files served to visitors verbatim or in Markdown format.
### How to create GitHub Pages:
To begin setting up your site, you have to open the Settings tab If you scroll down on the settings page, you’ll see the GitHub Pages section near the bottom. Click the Choose a theme button to start the process of creating your site.
# Basic writing and formatting syntax
Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with the simple syntax:
* Headings: To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.
* Quoting text: You can quote text with a >.
