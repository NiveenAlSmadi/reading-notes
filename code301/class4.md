### Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry
#####  Diversity 
70% of employees in tech were male in 2014. So basically, things are pretty lopsided. At some point the percentages of male to female tech graduates were leveled, but things have gone down since the 80s. It could be marketing or maybe that the way that companies hire is due to gender bias. 

Some believe that the way things were marketed may be the reason why female graduates have lowered since the 80s. Many video games and tech related advertising was aimed at males.There was actually a handheld gaming system called the 'Game Boy'. Side note, I am still salty that I was never able to own a game boy lol. 

Another reason why women are less likely to go into tech is that some have said that it feels isolated. It makes sense I think. I was once interested in becoming a nurse, but opted out partly because it is a female led career. I was concerned if people would accept me as a nurse being a dude lol. So in that perspective I guess it makes sense that some women would feel isolated going into a career that seems to be male dominated. 

# Diversity and Inclusion

Modern computer science is dominated by men. But it hasn't always been this way.

A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first digital computers — were women. And for decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But in 1984, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.

 The share of women in computer science started **falling** at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

Those that are new to diversity and inclusion often are unsure how to approach it — how to talk about the subject internally and externally, how to rank it among competing priorities and how to allocate appropriate resources. Before answering these questions, it’s helpful to identify why diversity and inclusion matters to you and your company specifically.

Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

### Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago

* there is a pronounced gender gap in technology fields
* In 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, were male. 
In technical roles, this phenomenon is even more pronounced; for example, only 10% of the technical workforce at Twitter is female.
* In 1984, 37% of computer science graduates were women, but those numbers began to drop dramatically in the middle of the decade
* By 2016, that number had been whittled down to 18%
