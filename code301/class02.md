##  jQuery, Events, and The DOM
![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*NeKYs9ypQ7jkalNxEX3t9Q.png)
 
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. 
It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation much simpler. 
All the power of jQuery is accessed via JavaScript, so having a strong grasp of JavaScript is essential for understanding, structuring, and debugging your code. 
The jQuery library contains the following features:

- HTML/DOM manipulation.
- CSS manipulation.
- HTML event methods.
- Effects and animations.
- AJAX.
- Utilities.

methods:
- .html()
- .text()
- .replaceWith()
- .remove()
- .attr()
- .addClass()
- .hide()
- .css()
- .each()

#### Query’s CSS-style 
selector syntax makes it easier to select elements to work with. It also has methods that make it easier to traverse the DOM.

jQuery makes it easier to handle events because the event methods work across all browsers.
jQuery offers methods that make it quick and simple to achieve a range of tasks that JavaScript programmers commonly need to perform.

## 6-reasons-for-pair-programming
### Why pair program?
While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages.
Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves

1. Greater efficiency
Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesnâ€™t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product)

2. Engaged collaboration
When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.

3. Learning from fellow students
Often times, the developers in a pairing have different skill sets. If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area. The less experienced developer benefits from the experienced developerâ€™s knowledge and guidance, and the latter benefits from explaining the topic in their own words, further solidifying their own understanding.

4. Social skills
When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities.
This has long-term career impacts. As much as employers want strong programmers, they know itâ€™s essential to hire people who can work well with others.

5. Job interview readiness
They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base.

For most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.

6. Work environment readiness
Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.
