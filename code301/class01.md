## Responsive Web Design
Responsive web design: is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

### Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile
Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change. Adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change. Mobile generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users.

Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, which are:

1. Flexible Layouts
It is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, using relative length units (mostly percentage or em), that are capable of dynamically resizing to any width.
2. Media Queries
Initializing Media Queries

### What is “Float”?
Float is a CSS positioning property. Absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the webpage, like when the text box in the print layout was told to ignore the page wrap.

### What are floats used for?
Floats can be used to create entire web layouts. Floats are also helpful for layout in smaller instances.

#### Clearing the Float
Float’s sister property is clear : An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float.
#### Problems with Floats
Floats often get beat on for being fragile.The majority of this fragility comes from IE 6 and the slew of float-related bugs it has.

### CSS Floats Explained By Riding An Escalator
Float elements create two lines, such as an escalator. It allows for content to flow on both the rigth and left of the containing element, making design much more fluid.

 - SMACSS refers to scalable and modular architecture for css

 - SMACSS is becoming one of the most useful contributions to front-end discussions in years

- It is a flexible guide for developing sites

- SMACSS is more style guide than rigid framework. There is no library within here for you to download or install. There is no git repository for you to clone. SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process. It is an attempt to document a consistent approach to site development when using CSS.
