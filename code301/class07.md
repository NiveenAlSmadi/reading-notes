## Rest 
#### Representational state transfer (REST)
REST is a de-facto standard for a software architecture for interactive applications that typically use multiple Web services.

- HTTP protocol: describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.
- WWW : The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. 
   REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

- A redirect is when a machines needs to send info to another machine by asking for the info from yet another machine.
- The url tells the browser that there are concepts somewhere.
- Every programming language uses the url.
- Polymorphism means you can different nouns can have the same verb attached to them.
- Browsers only get things.
- Web pages are designed to be understood by people. Machines have a different language.
- Post adds from one machine to another.
- Put replaces something in another system.
- Patch partially updates.
