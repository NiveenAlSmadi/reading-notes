## Rest 
#### Representational state transfer (REST)
REST is a de-facto standard for a software architecture for interactive applications that typically use multiple Web services.

- HTTP protocol: describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.
- WWW : The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. 
   REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

- A redirect is when a machines needs to send info to another machine by asking for the info from yet another machine.
- The url tells the browser that there are concepts somewhere.
- Every programming language uses the url.
- Polymorphism means you can different nouns can have the same verb attached to them.
- Browsers only get things.
- Web pages are designed to be understood by people. Machines have a different language.
- Post adds from one machine to another.
- Put replaces something in another system.
- Patch partially updates.

### API Key
An API key or application programming interface key is a code that gets passed in by computer applications. The program or application then calls the API or application programming interface to identify its user, developer or calling program to a website.

Application programming keys are normally used to assist in tracking and controlling how the interface is being utilized. Often, it does this to prevent abuse or malicious use of the API in question.

An API key can act as a secret authentication token as well as a unique identifier. Typically, the key will come with a set of access rights for the API that it is associated with.
