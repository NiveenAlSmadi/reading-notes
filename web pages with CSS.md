# HTML pages are text documents. 
HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements. 
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
  Attributes require a name and a value.
To learn HTML you need to know what tags are vailable for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
# css
CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.also CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.




CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside ,its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the  elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
Different types of selectors allow you to target your ,rules at different elements.
Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties  ,of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, , although they may appear within an HTML page.






















# SummaryCOLOR
1)Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker. Understanding Color Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels (if you look very closely at your monitor you should be able to see them).

2)The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue — just like on a television screen. 
- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
