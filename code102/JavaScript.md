# HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER ?
JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day. 
When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML <script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. 
Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored. 
You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags (but it is better to put scripts in their own files). 

if you view the source code of the page in the browser the js will not have changed the html , because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created .
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. 
You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code. 

A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables
A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs. 
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.
## so :
- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. 
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value. 
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.  
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
