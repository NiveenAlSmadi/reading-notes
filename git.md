# Git
is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file 
and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

## Workflow
Local Repository Structure
The local Git repository has three components:

Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
- Index: The area used for staging
- Head: Points to the most recent commit
